## Advanced Techniques for Financial Dashboards

### How can you use annotations to highlight key data points?

Annotations in ApexCharts allow developers to emphasize critical data points, such as transaction spikes or risk thresholds. This feature is particularly useful for financial dashboards where specific events need to stand out.

```typescript
const options = {
  chart: {
    type: 'line',
    height: 350
  },
  series: [
    {
      name: 'Transaction Volume',
      data: [450, 560, 700, 800, 900]
    }
  ],
  xaxis: {
    categories: ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May']
  },
  annotations: {
    points: [
      {
        x: 'Mar',
        y: 700,
        marker: {
          size: 8,
          fillColor: '#FF4560'
        },
        label: {
          text: 'Transaction Spike',
          style: {
            color: '#fff',
            background: '#FF4560'
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
};

const chart = new ApexCharts(document.querySelector("#chart"), options);
chart.render();
```

*Explanation:* This example adds an annotation to highlight a transaction spike in March. The `annotations` object specifies the point to emphasize, along with a label and marker for clarity.

### How do you create multi-series charts for comparative analysis?

Multi-series charts are essential for comparing different datasets, such as revenue versus expenses or customer acquisition across regions. Comparative analysis helps stakeholders identify trends, correlations, and outliers, enabling data-driven decision-making.

  },
  series: [
    {
      name: 'Revenue',
      data: [1000, 1200, 1500, 1700, 2000]
    },
    {
      name: 'Expenses',
      data: [800, 900, 1100, 1300, 1600]
    }
  ],
  xaxis: {
    categories: ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May']
  }
};

const chart = new ApexCharts(document.querySelector("#bar-chart"), options);
chart.render();
```

*Explanation:* This bar chart compares revenue and expenses over five months, providing a clear visual representation of financial performance.

### How can you make charts mobile-friendly?

To ensure charts are mobile-friendly, use responsive design features in ApexCharts. The `responsive` property allows you to define breakpoints and adjust chart settings accordingly.

```typescript
const options = {
  chart: {
    type: 'line',
    height: 350
  },
  series: [
    {
      name: 'Transaction Volume',
      data: [450, 560, 700, 800, 900]
    }
  ],
  xaxis: {
    categories: ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May']
  },
  responsive: [
    {
      breakpoint: 600,
      options: {
        chart: {
          height: 250
        },
        legend: {
          position: 'bottom'
        }

    chart: {
      type: 'line',
      height: 350
    },
    xaxis: {
      categories: ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May']
    }
  };

  const series = [
    {
      name: 'Transaction Volume',
      data: [450, 560, 700, 800, 900]
    }
  ];

  return <Chart options={options} series={series} type="line" height={350} />;
};
